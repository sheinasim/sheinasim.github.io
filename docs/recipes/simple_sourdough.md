## Instructions

1. Combine water and flour. Mix until it forms a shaggy dough and no dry flour remains. Rest dough for 1 hour.
2. Add starter and incorporate into dough. Add salt with 1 Tbl of water and knead in the bowl with aggressive stretch and folds. Knead until it passes the window pane test. Rest dough for 1 hour. 
3. Stretch and fold gently. Rest dough for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
4. Repeat gentle stretch and folds with 30 minutes to 1 hour rests in between until dough has doubled in size.
5. Pre-shape: After your dough has risen, gently pour out of the bowl into a floured or misted surface. Split dough into two. If adding inclusions, add them at this stage. Gently shape into two balls. Rest for 15 minutes. 
10. Shape: Using wet hands, shape the dough balls separately until they each have a taut skin. Flip each into a floured banneton and cover with a plastic bag. 
11. Proof: rest until dough comes back slowly after being poked.
12. Cold ferment: Place bannetons in the refrigerator over night until ready to bake.
13: The following day: When you're ready to bake, pre-heat cast iron dutch ovens at 500F for 1 hour.
14: Flip the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment. Score with a lame as desired. Place into separate dutch ovens and baked covered for 20 minutes. 
15. After 20 minutes, remove lids, lower oven temperature for 450F, and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
16. Remove from oven and out of cast irons. Allow to cool on wire racks.

## Notes 

*   Feed starter the evening prior so that it is ripe when you put your dough together.
*   Lower water to 520g if using lower protein flour. 
*   Serve with butter.
