- 800 g Bread (strong) flour
- 16 g salt

## Instructions

1. Combine 160 g of ripe starter with 560 g room temperature water in a large bowl.
2. Mix until starter is dissolved into the water. 
3. Add 800g of flour and 16 g of salt. Mix until it forms a shaggy dough.
4. Cover and set timer for 30 minutes (autolyse).
5. After 30 minutes, knead dough until no dry or hard lumps of flour remain. Set timer for 30 minutes.
6. First stretch and fold: after 30 minutes, with wet hands, pull up the edge of the dough and push it down towards the middle. Repeat with all edges of the dough.
7. Set a timer for 30 minutes, and repeat stretch and folds 3-5 more times. Stop when your dough passes the window pane test.
8. Bulk ferment: Once your dough passes the window pane test, cover and let rise until 150% to 200% in size. This takes about 2 hours in my warm kitchen.
9. Pre-shape: After your dough has risen, punch it down and split it into two equal doughs. Shape into rough balls and cover with bowls. Allow to rest for 15-20 minutes.
10. Shape: Using minimal flour, shape the dough balls separately until they each form a taut skin. Flip each into a floured banneton and cover with a plastic bag. 
11. Cold ferment: Place bannetons in the refrigerator over night until ready to bake.
12: The following day: When you're ready to bake, remove bannetons from the refrigerator and pre-heat cast iron dutch ovens at 500F for 1 hour.
13: Flip the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment. Score with a lame as desired. Place into separate dutch ovens and baked covered for 20 minutes. 
14. After 20 minutes, remove lids, lower oven temperature for 450F, and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
15. Remove from oven and out of cast irons. Allow to cool on wire racks.

## Notes 

*   Feed starter the evening prior so that it is ripe when you put your dough together.
*   Lower water to 520g if using lower protein flour. 
*   Serve with butter.
